# User Research

## Observation 1:
### Observation Statement: People prefer an app with ads over a paid app

### Supporting Data: 
- 100% of people surveyed said they’d rather have an app with ads.
- 0% said they wanted an app with an upfront cost and no ads.

### Team Action (if any):
We will create an app with ads and make it free to download.

## Observation 2:
### Observation Statement: Satisfaction rates vary drastically among responders

### Supporting Data:
- 16.7% dissatisfied
- 16.7% neither satisfied no dissatisfied
- 16.7% somewhat satisfied
- 16.7% very satisfied
- 33.3% frequently satisfied

### Team Action (if any):
This data reinforces the need for Buzzcut. Only half of all responders who go to the barber leave the shop satisfied. We believe Buzzcut will increase satisfaction rates among customers.

## Observation 3: 
### Observation Statement: majority of survey respondents don’t look for haircut inspiration when getting a haircut

### Supporting Data:
- 16.7% never
- 50% rarely
- 16.7% sometimes
- 16.7% somewhat often

### Team Action (if any):
This data provides support for the creation of Buzzcut, as it would provide more preparation and give people new ideas on what to do next time they go to the barber.

## Observation 4:
### Observation Statement: People prefer a personal relationship with their barber and are frequently left dissatisfied when seeing a different barber.

### Supporting Data: 
- Users responded in short paragraphs about their experiences with their barber such as “I like my personal relationship, and him knowing me and my hair, that I have with my barber,” and “I usually go to my preferred barber and get my usual haircut” 
- When going to other barbers, the haircuts are “hit or miss” as described by a submission

### Team Action (if any):
This data describes the personal relationship between barbers and the need for a way for users to be satisfied with other barbers if they are not aware of their particular haircut/style.
