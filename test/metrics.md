- In order to measure Net Promoter Score, we would offer users a chance to rate our app. This would either be a pop-up window or a small button on the profile or settings screen. A link would redirect them to a Google Survey that asks them to rate the app 1-10. We can then calculate the Net Promoter Score using the data from the survey.
